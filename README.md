# Synql

A proof of concept of a conflict-free replicated relational database that respects commonly used integrity constraints such as Foreign Keys and Unique Keys.

The current implementation relies on [SQLite](https://sqlite.org).

This work is inspired by the research paper [Conflict-free replicated relations for multi-synchronous database management at edge](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02983557) by Yu, Weihai and Claudia-Lavinia Ignat.

_Synql_ is written in SQL.
It can be used in existing database instances without changing the SQLite engine.
To do that, it adds metadata tables and triggers that allow to generate metadata upon modification of user tables.
Metadata allows to synchronize several database replicas and to resolve potential conflicts.

In contrast to prior works, _Synql_ identifies every row with a unique labeled timestamp.
A labeled timestamp consists in a [monotonically increasing timestamp](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-14472-6_2) and a replica identifier.
Every replica maintains a causal context that maps every replica identifier to the latest timestamp generated by the replica.
The causal context allows fine-grained synchronization between any pair of replicas.
Our approach also supports commonly used integrity constraint such as Foreign Keys and Unique Keys.
